# Udacity-Project-2

## Overview

This undertaking is a component of the Nanodegree Program for Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Engineer at Udacity. On this project, we ran AutoML on the Bank Marketing Dataset, deployed the best model as a RESTful API Webservice, used endpoints to communicate with the deployed model in Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio, and finally automated pipelines to enhance machine learning operations.


## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Key Steps
1. Authentication 

The optimal scenario is considered to have authentication paired with automation because human involvement slows down the process. A Service Principal is one of the authentication situations where the user role is provided with user-specific rights. However, I utilized my own account for the project. As stated in the project description, this stage is therefore bypassed. 

2. AutoML

We establish an AutoML experiment to select the best model based on accuracy metric. 

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
